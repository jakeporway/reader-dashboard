          "description": "Maria Popova revisits Simone de Beauvoir's 1970 meditation on aging, 'The Coming of Age,' arguing that old age need not become a parody of our former life. De Beauvoir insists the only antidote is 'to go on pursuing ends that give our existence a meaning \u2014 devotion to individuals, to groups or to causes, social, political, intellectual or creative work.' The piece weaves in Ursula K. Le Guin, Henry Miller, and Grace Paley's instructions on holding one's heart each morning. In a culture obsessed with anti-aging, this is a radical reframing: growing old as a fact to be met, not a project to be aced. Key takeaway: passion and compassion are the only things that keep the final chapter of life from collapsing into caricature.",

          "description": "When a teenager asked Nick Cave how to live a full creative life in 'a world ridden with so much hate and disconnect,' Cave responded with an electrifying letter about reading voraciously, visiting galleries, and cultivating centripetal curiosity. The piece resonates with W.E.B. Du Bois's advice to his daughter and David Bowie's idea of perfect happiness. Cave writes: 'Read. Read as much as possible. Read the big stuff, the challenging stuff, the confronting stuff, and read the fun stuff too.' In an era of algorithmic feeds and shrinking attention spans, Cave's analog prescription feels revolutionary. Key takeaway: the antidote to disconnection is radical, omnivorous curiosity.",

What follows is a cascade of decision paralysis, from hiking vs. gardening vs. TV to 'me day' vs. 'we day.' Schwartz argues that 'the theory underpinning much of decision-making science falls short as a way to think about how we actually make decisions.' Written over 20 years after his landmark book, when 'life was simpler because there were fewer options,' this piece updates behavioral economics for an age of infinite choice. Key takeaway: rational choice theory misses the mark because real decisions are embedded in relationships, identity, and meaning.",

The piece also reveals that earthquakes increase subsurface microbial activity 6.5-fold, with implications for finding life on other planets. It connects to our collective fascination with existential geological risk and the surprisingly thin crust between us and planetary catastrophe.

          "description": "Poet and ornithologist J. Drew Lanham engages in reverent exchanges with the birds that stop over at his home in rural South Carolina during their seasonal migrations. This short film by Jeremy Seifert and Benjamin James Roberts captures the intersection of science, poetry, and spiritual practice. Lanham's work bridges Black Southern identity, ecological consciousness, and the ancient human practice of reading meaning in bird flight. It connects to Emergence's broader 'Seasons' theme about the paradoxical ways seasons beckon us into relationship with Earth. Key takeaway: paying deep attention to the non-human world is simultaneously a scientific, poetic, and spiritual act.",

The essay draws on cutting-edge neuroscience to propose a richer understanding of neuroplasticity that accounts for growth, pruning, and the unpredictable emergence of new pathways.

Drawing on evidence from Pompeian frescoes and the 'abundance of good work discovered in a provincial town of perhaps 15,000 people,' the piece challenges the dominant narrative of Gods in Color exhibitions.

Privacy expert Chris Gilliard calls it 'a clumsy attempt by Ring to put a cuddly face on a rather dystopian reality: widespread networked surveillance.'

          "description": "Hungarian photographer Szilveszter Mak\u00f3 creates surreal portraits that deconstruct and reconstruct the human form, challenging conventional portraiture. Featured on Colossal on February 12, these images blend physical manipulation with photographic technique, creating compositions where bodies become landscapes and faces dissolve into abstraction. The work connects to a lineage from Man Ray's solarizations to contemporary body-horror art, but with a tenderness that transforms distortion into beauty. Key takeaway: the most interesting portraits aren't about capturing likeness \u2014 they're about revealing the strangeness already present in every body.",

The speech is a masterclass in narrative change: honest about the damage, hopeful about the future, and grounded in shared responsibility.

In a world where institutional trust is cratering (media, government, tech companies), this 30-minute experience reframes the conversation from 'people are terrible' to 'incentive structures matter.' Key takeaway: small changes to the rules of a game can flip an entire population from mutual suspicion to cooperation.

It is a guard dog that got confused about who the burglars are.\" The mechanic of playing-as-the-fear is genuinely innovative and emotionally disarming. Created with input from actual therapists, it models Cognitive Behavioral Therapy principles through gameplay rather than lectures.

Le Guin, Henry Miller, and Grace Paley to create a meditation on what it means to age well in a culture terrified of aging at all. De Beauvoir argues that old age becomes 'life's parody' only when we let it \u2014 when we stop engaging with the world, stop creating, stop holding our hearts in our hands each morning. \"Old age is life's parody, whereas death transforms life into a destiny: in a way it preserves it by giving it the absolute dimension.\" Popova contextualizes this against our botox-and-silence culture, reminding us that growing old at all is a 'tremendous privilege \u2014 one withheld from the vast majority of humans populating the history of our young species.' Published on the eve of Valentine's Day, it's a love letter to the long arc of a life fully lived. Key takeaway: the antidote to aging badly isn't youth \u2014 it's remaining engaged, curious, and emotionally brave. Questions to ponder: What would it mean to become 'a person worthy of old age'?

          "description": "Peter Lukacs dismantles one of pop science's most beloved metaphors \u2014 that we can 'rewire' our brains like an electrician fixing a circuit. The essay traces the metaphor from a 1912 British surgeon comparing nerves to house wiring, through the 1960s neuroplasticity revolution, to today's app-store promises of brain optimization. \"Unlike electrical wiring, which follows rigid, fixed paths, the brain's connectivity is dynamic and constantly changing.\" Lukacs argues the brain is more like a forest than a circuit board \u2014 growing, pruning, adapting through ecology rather than engineering. The piece doesn't dismiss neuroplasticity but insists we understand it properly: change is slower, messier, and more incomplete than the metaphor suggests. This matters because bad metaphors lead to bad expectations, especially for stroke patients and trauma survivors. Key takeaway: your brain changes, but not like swapping wires \u2014 it's more like tending a garden. Questions to ponder: What other engineering metaphors do we misapply to biological systems? How might a 'forest' metaphor for the brain change how you approach learning?",

          "description": "Yogi Hale Hendlin makes the case for solarpunk \u2014 not as science fiction but as a genuine design philosophy where technology takes its cues from living systems rather than dominating them. The essay introduces 'the Symbiocene,' philosopher Glenn Albrecht's proposed successor to the Anthropocene, where human technologies work in partnership with nature. \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from nature\" \u2014 Karl Schroeder's inversion of Clarke's famous law serves as the essay's animating principle. Hendlin connects ancient practices like chinampas (Aztec floating gardens) with high ecotech like atmospheric water harvesters, arguing that solarpunk treats science as plural \u2014 shaped by culture, landscape, and values. The 'punk' isn't anti-technology; it's anti-domination. Key takeaway: the future doesn't have to be dystopian OR naively utopian \u2014 solarpunk offers a third path where we design WITH nature. Questions to ponder: What would your city look like if every new building had to pass a 'biomimicry test'? Is solarpunk realistic or just aesthetically pleasing escapism?",

          "description": "Brandon Keim writes a lyrical, scientifically grounded meditation on what bumblebees might experience in their final autumn days \u2014 lying atop New England asters, their stomachs full of pollen, as temperatures drop. Research shows bee sleep alternates between deep slumber and REM, much like our own; experiments demonstrate they have emotions, selective attention, and cognitive biases. \"I like to think they will be content\" \u2014 and remarkably, the science gives us permission to think so. Keim bridges the gap between hard neuroscience (bees taught to associate ambiguous stimuli with reward become 'optimistic') and poetic wonder, refusing to let either diminish the other. Published in early February 2026, it's a piece that reframes autumn mortality as something gentle rather than grim. Key takeaway: the inner lives of insects are far richer than we assumed, and recognizing this changes how we relate to the living world. Questions to ponder: If bees dream, what do they dream about? How would our environmental policies change if we took insect consciousness seriously?",

This essay explores the International Dark Sky movement and why darkness is essential for human imagination, wildlife, and health. \"Light pollution has increased worldwide nearly 10 percent every year between 2011 and 2022\" \u2014 a staggering statistic that means most humans alive today have never seen a truly dark sky.

Thomas Edison, she notes wryly, 'ruined everything.' The piece makes you want to drive to the nearest dark sky park. Key takeaway: darkness isn't the absence of something good \u2014 it's a vital presence we're losing. Questions to ponder: When did you last see the Milky Way?

Should you hike? Garden? Watch TV? Read? Call your daughter? Help your mother? Each option triggers cascading considerations that reveal our decisions are never purely rational calculations. \"Who knew that all this freedom of choice would be this hard? You could occupy the whole day just deciding what to do.\" Schwartz argues that standard decision theory assumes we can rank preferences cleanly, but real life involves incommensurable values \u2014 self-care vs. duty, ambition vs. rest, me vs. we. The piece is both behavioral science and self-help, written with warmth and humor. Key takeaway: the difficulty of choosing what to do with a free day reveals that human decision-making is fundamentally about values, not optimization. Questions to ponder: Do you spend more time deciding what to do than actually doing it? Is having fewer options genuinely freeing?",

The guide includes actionable steps for cultivating intuition while also learning to distinguish it from bias and wishful thinking.

You can avoid that trap with realistic planning.\" The guide distinguishes defensive pessimism from anxiety and depression, showing it's an active cognitive strategy rather than a mood disorder. Norem provides concrete exercises for harnessing worst-case thinking productively. It's a perfect antidote to toxic positivity culture and pairs beautifully with Nicky Case's anxiety game. Key takeaway: imagining failure isn't defeatism \u2014 it's preparation, and it actually reduces anxiety by giving you a plan.

She arrived in New York because of the Velvet Underground \u2014 literally.</p><blockquote>\"My photography teacher said, 'Your photos are so boring. Find something you like and get close.' Those are the only two things he said.\"</blockquote><p>What's remarkable is how every major career break came from cold emails, not connections. Her story is a masterclass in creative persistence and the role of luck in creative careers. For anyone working in innovation or design, her message resonates: show up, keep putting work out there, and never take your career for granted. The interview is warm, real, and full of practical wisdom about sustaining a creative life long-term.</p>",

The author argues the sector doesn't have an RCT problem \u2014 it has a rigor and standards problem. Only 6% of evaluators have ever used experimental methods, and most organizations lack even minimal evaluative frameworks.</p><blockquote>\"We are not producing reliable knowledge about what works, regardless of the method used. Reporting requirements often prioritize speed, volume, and compliance over understanding.\"</blockquote><p>For anyone in social innovation, HCD, or philanthropy, this is essential reading. The piece challenges both the RCT evangelists and their critics, arguing that the real gap is institutional capacity for learning. It connects directly to how we design feedback loops in programs \u2014 are we measuring to learn, or measuring to report? The implications for how foundations fund evaluation work are significant.</p>",

The author makes a compelling case for the latter, arguing that the saturated, matte paint jobs in exhibitions like \"Gods in Color\" may be wildly inaccurate.</p><blockquote>\"In the eyes of modern viewers, at least, the addition of this matte, heavily saturated color has turned a really good work of art into a really bad one.\"</blockquote><p>This is the kind of longform essay that changes how you see things \u2014 literally. It touches on perception, design assumptions, the gap between data and interpretation, and how expert consensus can calcify around poor reconstructions.

          "description": "<p>Helen Oxenbury \u2014 the illustrator behind <em>We're Going on a Bear Hunt</em>, <em>So Much</em>, and countless other beloved children's books \u2014 gives a remarkably candid interview about her 60-year career. She started illustrating not from passion but necessity: married to fellow illustrator John Burningham, they couldn't afford childcare, so she began drawing at home.</p><blockquote>\"Children are the same now as they were 100 years ago. What they like, what they find funny, what they find sad, and what they find exciting \u2014 it's the same.\"</blockquote><p>Her advice for aspiring illustrators is brutally honest. Her style \u2014 calm, realistic, full of movement \u2014 emerged naturally from watching her husband work, with no formal illustration training. The interview is a masterclass in authenticity: creating for children means respecting their intelligence and emotional complexity. A wonderful reminder that the best design work often comes from constraints and observation, not formal training.</p>",

          "description": "<p>American household water costs have more than doubled since the early 1980s (inflation-adjusted) even as per-capita use decreased. This deeply researched essay traces how federal regulators, starting with the Clean Water Act of 1972, treated local water systems as delinquent \u2014 despite their century of massive improvements \u2014 and ratcheted up mandates regardless of diminishing returns.</p><blockquote>\"San Francisco was ordered to spend almost $11 billion \u2014 $13,000 for every man, woman, and child \u2014 updating its sewage systems.\"</blockquote><p>The piece draws a parallel to nuclear power's cost spiral: the same \"safetyism\" that made nuclear expensive is making water unaffordable. For anyone interested in systems design, infrastructure, or why well-intentioned regulation can produce perverse outcomes, this is essential. It's also a powerful case study in how eliminating all risk, no matter how trivial, can make systems worse for the people they're meant to protect.</p>",

She started comedy later in life with no background in standup, and her process of writing on stage, recording everything, and rewriting is pure iterative design.</p><blockquote>\"I used to be really scared that I would run out of funny. And I used to worry that I'd be too tired to do a show. But I realized I've understood how adrenaline works.\"</blockquote><p>Her cross-cultural perspective \u2014 from Bollywood to Carol Burnett to the Philippines \u2014 gives her comedy a unique lens. For creative professionals, her journey is a reminder that starting late, embracing imperfection, and caring less about others' opinions can be liberating rather than limiting. The interview connects to behavioral science themes around perfectionism, creative confidence, and the iteration mindset.</p>",
